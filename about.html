          <p class="whiteText changeFont">My name is Kevin Lim, I&rsquo;m a 20 year old aspiring shut in. I enjoy spending hours in my parents&rsquo; basement playing Fallout 4, World of Warcraft, and League of Legends exclusively in that order. My diet consists of strictly hot pockets, bagel bites, and cup ramen to fuel my everyday regimen of professional gaming. Don&rsquo;t ever tell me to go outside because I won&rsquo;t. Vitamin D is for fools. Don&rsquo;t tell me otherwise because you&rsquo;re wrong.</p>

Before coming to code fellows he taught himself how to code but still has much to learn to write good clean code that functions smoothly.</p>
