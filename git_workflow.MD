Git Hub Flow

Chris will create the repo with the following directories and files:

index.html
js directory
images directory
css directory
fonts directory
README.MD
variablesList.md
user_stories.md
git_workflow.md

Guys, make sure before tearing your code apart that you make sure you have properly linked the files in the right places.


We are going to create a master branch and a developer branch
Pushes to the development branch are done after code is vetted by the team
Pushes to the master branch are done only by Chris and only after the team has vetted all features and branches.
Create working branches off the developer branch using the following guidlines

bug_bugname - for fixing bugs.
feature_featurename - for adding in new features
milestone_milestonename -for adding a group or set of features //do we need this feature?

As a general practice we decided that we want to avoid having two people working on the same branch to avoid merging problems. If we get to a place where something needs to be completed before we can move on to the next set of issues we will use pair programming instead.
